#A chrome extension demo - save what you read into a mindmap 

##What this repository is for?

This repository is for storing and managing files of a chrome extension demo.

##Why making this chrome extension demo?

For people who browse and read on the internet, they may want to save pieces of information (text) that they read from the webpage. 
In common saving tools, such as Evernote, those pieces of information are saved into a notebook, and sometimes with tags. 
However, those saved information may never be read again by users because they are fractual pieces, not structural, and difficult to find whenever users need them. 
Unlike these tools, **this chrome extension intends to save users' interested information and automatically generate a 'mindmap' for structural and visual
demonstration.** 
As users browse and read more about the same topic, the mindmap will 'flourish' as well so does the users' knowledge about a topic. 
Therefore, the knowledge has been kept for the user. 

This tool is desperatedly needed by people who:
```
1. regularly intake a lot of text based information (e.g. reports, news); 
2. they want to digest those information and form a rational judgement. 
```
##How does the user interact with this tool after their installations?

1. Users select text on a web browser(by using a mouse).
2. A popup window will come out with suggested 'root' tags, which users need to choose by clicking or users can type in their own tags.
3. Then, the popup window will refresh with suggested 'branch tags', which are closest in logic to the previous selected tag.
4. If users think the root tag has already very well categorized their selection, then users can click on 'save' button and finish the action. 
5. Or if they want to choose those 'branch' tags, then they can click on those tags or type in their owns.
6. Steps 3 - 5 will be continued until users click on 'save' button and finish the action. 

In another interface, users can see their saved information through a mindmap seperated by root tags, which they can edit as well.
