-Q:What is the context of having this demo_test folder?
-A:The whole project is about a chrome extension, which comprises of front end and back end programming. Therefore, the implementation has been divided into front-end and back-end. On the other hand, the chrome extension provided functionality to any webpage opened on a web browser, which gives complexity for testing. While developing the back-end and integrating the functionality of the back-end to front-end, this ‘demo_test’ folder was set up as an intermediate layer, which provides only one webpage but with the front-end functionality as the chrome extension provides.
